# greenfoot-physics-engine

Now before I receive critism for the lack of angular momentum or just straight up momentum in my engine (yeah it's starting to sound bad) keep in mind I wrote this code when I was just started taking Gr 11 Physics, where all that was important were the velocities of objects. If you're having trouble finding the important class look in the "Physics Object" class. It handles collisions and includes gravity.

If you're feeling brave take a look at my portal class to see how I managed to implement a portal gun! I honestly don't plan on remaking a physics engine for Greenfoot so I'll let some other deranged Gr 12 to share their code with the world.
